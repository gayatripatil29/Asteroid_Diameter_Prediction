# Asteroid diameter prediction
What all is out there in space is still a mystery. Scientists are always trying to search for something new in space. While a lot is expected to be discovered, let us look at what has been found.

#### ASTEROIDS !! 
They have always been interesting as current theory suggest that asteroids are planetisimals, the building blocks of planets that were never incorporated into one of the eight planets in our solar system.

- So what exactly are asteroids? 

By definition asteroids are small, rocky objects that orbit the Sun. Although asteroids orbit the Sun like planets, they are much smaller than planets.

- Why are they important? 

Well they may tell us about the origins of our solar system, They may help us understand more about the origin of life, We may want to mine near-earth asteroids for metals, They may someday threaten to collide with Earth and many more such reasons.

These questions are very important from our perspective because if the asteroid is made up of some valuable metal, the larger it is the more beneficial it may be to us. Also if the asteroid is large and near to the Earth it may very well prove to be fatal to the planet. This leads to another question which is how do we know which asteroid is large enough to be mined for metals if they do exists or large enough to be dangerous to the planet?
Determining the size of the asteroid may lead us to some conclusion about the impact of the asteroid. Size of the asteroid is measured in terms of diameter and predicting the diameter of the asteroid may help us in our quest of approximating the dangers or benefits the asteroids presents to the planet 


### Terminology
- A -> semi-major axis	

The semi-major axis of an asteroid is used to describe the dimensions of its orbit around the Sun, and its value determines the minor planet's orbital period.	

- E -> eccentricity	

The axis marked eccentricity is a measure of how far from circular each orbit is. The smaller the eccentricity number is, the more circular the orbit is.	

- G -> Magnitude slope parameter	

It relates to the opposition effect.  Its value depends on the way light is scattered by particles on the asteroid’s surface.	

- I -> Inclination with respect to x-y ecliptic plane (degree)	

Orbital inclination measures the tilt of an object's orbit around a celestial body. It is expressed as the angle between a reference plane and the orbital plane or axis of direction of the orbiting object.	

- Om -> Longitude of the ascending node

It is one of the orbital elements used to specify the orbit of an object in space. It is the angle from a reference direction, called the origin of longitude, to the direction of the ascending node, measured in a reference plane

- W -> argument of perihelion

In astronomy, the argument of periapsis (ω) is a way of talking about the orbit of a planet, asteroid or comet. It is also known as the argument of perihelion or the argument of perifocus. It is the angle (starting from the centre of the orbit) between an orbiting body's periapsis and its ascending node

- Q -> perihelion distance	

The closest distance between asteroid and the sun 	

- Ad -> aphelion distance	

The furthest distance between asteroid and the sun 	

- Per_y -> Orbital period	

The amount of time asteroid takes to orbit the sun 	

- H -> Absolute Magnitude parameter	

An asteroid’s absolute magnitude is the visual magnitude an observer would record if the asteroid were placed 1 Astronomical Unit (au) away, and 1 au from the Sun and at a zero phase angle.

- Diameter -> Diameter of asteroid (Km)	
	
- rot_per -> Rotation Period(h)	

The period of time the asteroid takes to rotate on its axis 	


- Albedo -> geometric albedo	

Albedo refers to an object's measure of reflectivity, or intrinsic brightness.

- GM -> Standard gravitational parameter	

The standard gravitational parameter μ of a celestial body is the product of the gravitational constant G and the mass M of the body.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_gravitational_parameter

- Neo -> Near Earth Object		

- Pha -> Physically Hazardous Asteroid		

- Moid -> Earth Minimum orbit Intersection Distance(au)	

Minimum orbit intersection distance (MOID) is a measure used in astronomy to assess potential close approaches and collision risks between astronomical objects.[1][2] It is defined as the distance between the closest points of the osculating orbits of two bodies
